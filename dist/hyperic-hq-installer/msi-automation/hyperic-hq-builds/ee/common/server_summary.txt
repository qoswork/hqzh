The HQ Server has been successfully installed.

You can start and stop your HQ Server by selecting the "Start Server" and "Stop Server" shortcuts respectively under the Hyperic application group in the Windows Start menu.

Alternatively, you can then use the Service Control Manager (Control Panel->Services) to manually start and stop the Hyperic HQ server.  Note that the first time the HQ server starts up it may take several minutes to initialize.  Subsequent startups will be much faster.

Once the HQ server reports that it has successfully started, you can log in to your HQ server at: 

http://%WEB_HOST%:%WEB_PORT%/
username: %ADMIN_USER%
password: %ADMIN_PASSWORD%

To change your password, log in to the HQ server, click the "Administration" link, choose "List Users", then click on the "%ADMIN_USER%" user.
