# This folder contains multiple support-commands.* and helper-commands.* files, as explained in support-commands.common.
#
# Here is a list of the possible architectures for the system, which define the possible extensions for the support-commands and helper-commands files.
# The list of architectures is identical to the one used inside the pom.xml files.
#
# * apple-osx
# * hpux-11
# * ppc-aix
# * sparc-solaris
# * x86-linux
# * x86-64-linux
# * win32
#
# Please note that the actual detection of the architecture is part of the scripts/hq_utils.py script.
